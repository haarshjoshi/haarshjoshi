# üí´ Hi! I'm Harsh:
I'm a Junior Data Scientist at DHI, deeply passionate about leveraging data to uncover insights and drive innovation. With a robust background in Python, my current focus is on developing pipelines for Large Language Models (LLM), blending technical expertise with creative problem-solving.<br>I thrive on continuous learning and excel in collaborative, disciplined team environments. I have engaged in enriching summer projects at renowned institutions like Monash University and the Indian Institute of Technology, Indore. These experiences were pivotal in shaping my hands-on skills in data analysis, offering a real-world perspective to my theoretical knowledge.<br>Academically, my journey through Bachelor‚Äôs in Mathematics and Master of Data Science was marked by excellence. This dedication to academia was recognised through prestigious scholarships for academic achievement. Furthermore, I received a commendation letter from the Director of IT for securing high grades and was International Student Advocate at Monash University.
