# üí´ Hi! I'm Harsh:
I'm a Data Scientist, deeply passionate about leveraging data to uncover insights and drive innovation. With a robust background in Python and Power BI, my current focus is on developing pipelines for data ingestion and dashboard development blending technical expertise with creative problem-solving.
I thrive on continuous learning and excel in collaborative, disciplined team environments. I have engaged in enriching summer projects at renowned institutions like Monash University and the Indian Institute of Technology, Indore. These experiences were pivotal in shaping my hands-on skills in data analysis, offering a real-world perspective to my theoretical knowledge.
Academically, my journey through Bachelor‚Äôs in Mathematics and Master of Data Science was marked by excellence. This dedication to academia was recognised through prestigious scholarships for academic achievement. Furthermore, I received a commendation letter from the Director of IT for securing high grades and was International Student Advocate at Monash University.
